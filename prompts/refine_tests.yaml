task: "Refine C++ Unit Test File"

instructions:
  - Include forward declarations of any functions used in test cases that are not defined in this file.
  - Keep only the code â€” do NOT output explanations, markdown, comments, or headers.
  - Group tests by logical test suites using `TEST(SuiteName, TestCaseName)` format.
  - Fix any missing headers or function declarations so that the test file compiles.
  - Do NOT remove test cases unless they are syntactically or semantically invalid.
  - Use clean and minimal Google Test code structure that compiles and runs.
