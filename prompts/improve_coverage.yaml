task: "Improve Unit Test Coverage for C++ Code"

instructions:
  - Analyze the code coverage data (e.g., lcov `.info` file or summary).
  - Identify which functions or branches are missing test coverage.
  - Write new test cases to increase overall function and line coverage.
  - Focus especially on:
      - Edge cases
      - Boundary conditions
      - Exception paths
      - Unusual inputs
  - Integrate the new test cases into the appropriate test suites.
  - Use the Google Test framework with `#include <gtest/gtest.h>`.
  - Use only Google Test macros such as `EXPECT_EQ`, `EXPECT_THROW`, `ASSERT_TRUE`, etc.
  - Do NOT duplicate existing test cases or introduce redundant logic.
  - Do NOT remove or rewrite valid existing tests.
  - Output must be clean, compilable, valid C++ code.
  - Do NOT include:
      - Any markdown
      - Any comments
      - Any explanations
      - A `main()` function if already present
